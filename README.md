ðŸ“ŠI am thrilled to present my latest project for Codebasics challange #9.



AtliQ Mart is a retail giant having 50 supermarkets across 10 cities of Southern India.In this analysis I scrutenized the effectiveness of promotional campaign during Diwali 2023 & Sankranti 2024 .It sells 15 products under 5 categories.

Key Objectives:-
*Evaluate campaign performance.
*Identifying the top performing cities.
*Identifying the top performing products.
*Effectiveness of promotion types.
*Provide insights for informed decission making .


Data Overview:-
The data contains 4 tables.
âž¡ Dim_stores
âž¡Dim_products
âž¡Dim_campaigns
âž¡Fact_events

Tools Used-
âž¡MySQL
âž¡POWER BI
âž¡CANVA

Highlights of my findings-

 âž¡Store- performance- Indentified top 10 stores based on Incremental Revenue & Incremental Sold Units.

âž¡Promotion_type Analysis- 500 cash back & BOGOF promotions generate highest incremental revenue.

âž¡Product & Category Analysis- Highest Incremental revenue is coming from Grocery& staple, Home appliances & Home care categories due to the promotion type BOGOF & 500 cashback.

âž¡Campaign_wise Analysis- The Incremental Revenue % is more during Sankranti than Diwali. But the total revenue is more during Diwali campaign.



ðŸ’°Business Insight:-  Fascinating insights from the analysis  will definitely  enhance the process of decission making.

Key Performane indicators

IR%( Incremental Revenue %)=110.10%
ISU%( Incremental Sold Unit %)= 211.28

-> Cities like Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad are top revenue generators with a focus needed on optimizing resources due to their high store count. "BOGOF" promotion is driving maximum revenue in these cities during Sankranti.

->In Trivandrum and Vijayawada, expanding the number of stores is essential to increase revenue as the current stores are generating the least revenue.

->During Diwali, 500 cash back is effective for Combo category sales compared to Sankranti.

->n the Grocery category, "BOGOF", "25% OFF", and "33% OFF" are used as promo types, with BOGOF generating the most revenue. Sales are higher during Sankranti compared to Diwali

->In the Home Appliances category, the "BOGOF" promotion generates the highest revenue, but due to the high base price, it is seen as a significant discount, resulting in a lower increase in IR% compared to ISU%.

->In home care, the highest revenue comes from BOGOF promotions, but double bed sheets, being high-value products with heavy discounts, require reconsideration.

->Using promotion types of 25% OFF and 50% OFF in personal care did not significantly impact incremental revenue or sold units count.

-> 500 cash back & BOGOF both promotions generate the highest revenue.

->Implementing a strategy of increasing base prices can lead to higher revenue along with BOGOF promotype.

-> Sales are rising with the "BOGOF" home care promotion, but a new strategy is needed due to the high value of the products.
